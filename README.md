AeroSwift X1 - Drone for Sale Landing Page 🚁
This is a simple responsive landing page for a fictional drone called AeroSwift X1. It was created as a front-end mini project to practice and apply basic HTML and CSS skills.

Through this project, I was able to:

🧱 Practice building structured layouts using HTML5 semantic elements

🎨 Improve my design eye by using desaturated, modern color combinations

🧭 Add simple navigation with clear, organized sections

💬 Practice writing content like features, testimonials, and contact info
